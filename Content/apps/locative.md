**Privacy aware home automation and location tracking.**

Create Geofences to define regions you'd like to use for triggering events. Position and region of the Geofence can be freely defined.

Locative also supports defining triggers based on iBeacons. Any vendor is supported as long as they follow the iBeacon specs.

When entering locations an optional webhook will be executed, alongside your device id as well as current location. Perfect for your home-automation.
